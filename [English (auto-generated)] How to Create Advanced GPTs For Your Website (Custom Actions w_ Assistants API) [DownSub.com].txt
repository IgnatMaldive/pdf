in this video I'll be showing you step

by step how to create an insanely

powerful lead generation custom GPT with

multiple custom actions and add it to

any website if you're watching this

you've probably already created some

awesome gpts within the chat GPT Builder

but you want to break them out of the

chat GPT site and start using them in

the real world or you want to learn more

about how to add powerful custom actions

to your gpts to make them more useful

for your use case unfortunately a lot of

people still don't understand what the

new assistance API is and even I was

confused by it at first but knowing what

it is and how to build your own custom

gpts with it puts you in the top 1% of

people who are chasing down this

opportunity so by the end of this video

you'll not only know how to build your

own custom gpts using the assistant API

and put them on your websites but you'll

also know how to plan create and

Implement insanely powerful custom

actions into your gpts to create real

value for your businesses or for your

clients and at the end end of the video

I'll be giving away everything that I'm

building today as a template so that you

can steal this insanely powerful lead

generation chatbot and start using it in

your own business or selling it yourself

if you're new to the channel and don't

know who I am my name is Liam otley and

I run my own sixf figure development

company called morning side Ai and I

also run the largest community of AI

agency owners in the world where my

students learn how to make money by

selling AI solutions to businesses just

like the lead generation chat bot that

you're about to build let's get into it

to kick things off I'm actually going to

be showing you the finished product here

on screen so that you get an idea of

where we're going with this and how much

value we are creating when we do this

right so on screen is a template website

that I've downloaded just refreshing the

page so you can see that it's live if I

click on the widget in the right here up

Pops the chat window and I can start

talking to it hi I'm Lucy Smith's solar

assistant I can help you with any

questions on solar for your home I can

also calculate the potential solar

savings for your property how can I help

you today that gives you an idea of the

two functionalities of this chat bot so

firstly we can ask questions to the

knowledge base what is the

cheapest type of panel this will be

querying our knowledge based document

which you guys will get to see in a

second it's a general faq's and

information brochure for anything

related to solar for single family homes

here we have the answer the cheapest

type of solar panel is poly crystalline

solar panel great so that shows the

knowledge Bas is working but more

importantly here's the feature help me

calulate my soul solar

savings help me calculate my solar

saving plit the assistant is going to

pick up on this and going to realize

that we need two inputs which is going

to be their home address and their

monthly electricity bill in USD so for

this I'm picking someone's lucky address

um in the United States so let's grab

this one here click on this sorry to

whoever's homeless is broadcasting your

address out copy this head back and if I

just put in just the address here it

should ask me for the monthly bill as

well cuz it needs the two inputs to

calculate this great thanks for sharing

your address to proceed I'll also need

your average monthly electricity bill so

let's say I'm spend $250 $ per month now

it's going to take that address it's

going to take that monthly cost of power

and it's going to call the Google solar

API bring it back and tell us exactly

what kind of savings we can expect for

our property if we choose to convert to

solar there we have it it's given us a

full breakdown of our options for solar

based off allocation I'll break this

down a little bit more later it's really

really complex stuff that's going on

behind the scenes here but essentially

it's giving us information like our

payback period and the 20e savings we're

going to experience any federal

incentives that are associated with our

location but that's not even all this

thing at the end it asks for a lead

capture so it's asking me for my phone

number and my name and then if I provide

that I go Le artly and I give it a phone

number phone

number and I give that to them then what

this is going to do is take that

information and it's going to a take my

address and it's going to push that all

to a CRM which I'm going to show you how

to set up later and then we have it

thank you your details have been passed

to our team someone will be in touch

with you soon so that's the breakdown

and a demo of the bot but before we get

into the building I need to do a little

bit of explanation so that you're fully

clear on the difference between creating

gpts as you are on chat GPT and creating

your own cool ones within the chat GPT

website and the kind of thing that we're

building over here which is using the

assistant API these are your two

different ways of creating gpts now on

the chat GPT Builder they are locked

inside of that of the interface you

can't take what you create on the chat

GPT site when you build these things and

then go and slap that on your website or

put that on WhatsApp or put it wherever

you want you are locked into that and

it's intended for you to just use it in

there as a handy little kind of personal

tool I've said that gpts in this way are

like consumer toys they're focused for

the mass market and and consumers to

engage and have fun with and build these

gpts but the other side of this is using

the assistance API I've been over this

recently in my other videos but it's

important that you understand the

difference and that most of the value is

going to be unlocked through this

assistance API because this allows

businesses and anyone really to take

that same GPT functionality that you

create there which is really cool but

then take that and put it wherever you

want integrate it into any application

any website any voice assistant whatever

you want so what I'm teaching you in

this video is how to use that side of

thing is the assistance API Which is far

more powerful and is going to create far

more value in our world and really be a

much more valuable skill than being able

to make uh little fun gbts on the chat

gbt website then we need to get into a

little bit of a deeper breakdown of what

we're building and how we're going to

build it so if you haven't figured out

already we're making a lead generation

chat bot for solar companies that's

going to be put on their website which

is intended to help leads and people who

are interacting with the website to get

to their questions firstly if they have

any questions related to hey what solar

panel is the best what financing options

what's this what's that anything that

they could want to ask as if they were

talking to a solar expert we're going to

allow them to ask that to the chat bot

which can respond from a knowledge base

using a document that we're provided

containing this kind of information

secondly this chat will also allow them

to calculate their potential solar

savings if they were to install a system

and we're going to do that by taking in

their address and their monthly powerb

and sending that off to Google solar API

and getting the response back from that

and then finally once I've got that back

from the calculator tool we're going to

ask them for their lead information so

we can capture the lead and follow them

up we can break it down into my three

ingredients concept for creating gbts

which is prompting knowledge and actions

the prompting is going to tell it that

it is an assistant for Smith solar that

it can answer questions from a knowledge

base regarding solar questions and it

can also provide calculations and it can

also capture the lead at the end of it

so that's all the information that we're

stuffing into the problem for the

knowledge component we are uploading a

single document containing a ton of

information on solar for single family

homes and finally the actions are going

to be calculate solar savings using the

solar API and then capture the lead and

send it to air table the stack of

technology that we're using to create

this assistant is firstly the assistant

API of course the solar API and

geocoding API from Google repet to host

it and voice flow to be the front end

for it okay to get started you need to

Fork my refet template which is going to

be available in the first link in the

description you can sign up to my

resource Hub it's 100% free and there'll

be a link in the resource hub for this

particular video where you can get

access to this rip now when you click on

the link it's going to take you to the

screen and what you're going to want to

do is click on the fork button on the

right here and we're going to give it a

name solar lead gen

chatbot and we can Fork

it if you give it a second it will boot

up in here then you'll be greeted with

this here for those of you who aren't

developers or don't know how to code

this might seem a little bit

overwhelming but don't worry i' set this

up in a way where you don't need to do

any any major changes to get the kind of

results you're looking for and any ones

that you do I'll Point them out very

clearly and it's just a couple

characters or words that you need to

change so we have our main.py file here

which has our endpoints the chat inpoint

and the start inpoint don't worry too

much about this we have the functions.

pi file which has all the specific

functionality such as creating a lead on

a table such as pulling the data from

the solar API Etc so all of the the fun

stuff happens in here then at the bottom

we have our create assistant function I

have gone pretty heavy on the comments

throughout this file so when it comes to

modifying it and changing the knowledge

or the functions there should be plenty

of comments to help you figure out what

you need to do but I'll take you through

a crash course now because I know many

of you will want to take this change the

knowledge change the function so this is

how you can do it so for changing the

knowledge which is the easiest one to do

we have the knowledge. docx which is

referencing the document on the left

here so if you want to change the

document you can delete that and you can

upload a new one by clicking this so you

can upload a new file and just make sure

that the name of the file is referenced

here exactly if you want to add multiple

files you'll need to copy and paste this

multiple times and save them to

different files I recommend that you

paste this entire function from the top

down and to check gbt and say hey I'd

like to add multiple files cuz it needs

to add a couple different rows here

duplicate that and then down the bottom

here we need to pass in more than one

file ID so that's for changing the

knowledge for changing the instructions

we have this instructions assistant

instructions variable reference here and

what this is actually doing is pulling

from up here we have an import from our

prompts file and on the left here is the

prompts file that we're talking about so

the assistant instructions and the

prompts STP if you want to change the

instructions for your assistant this is

where you need to do it so by changing

this you can take a look at how I've set

this thing up here but by changing this

you're going to change the prompting and

the behavior of the chatot and the

information in here as you look at my

stuff you'll see that it's referencing

how to use the knowledge it's

referencing how to use the tools and

what to do after so one of the cool

things that I added in here was that

after the assistant has provided the

user with their solar calculations they

should ask for their name and phone

number so that one of the team can get a

contact with them about installing solar

for their home so that is instructing it

to after you've triggered that tool then

do this which is what you'll see later

in the app where it actually asks for

the lead capture at the end of the

response from the tool so if you want to

change the prompting and the

instructions you need to come to the

prompt stop High file modify that if you

want to change the knowledge you need to

come to the top of the create assistance

function and modify this and modify your

documents when it comes to modifying the

functions it's definitely the harder

part but I'll try to walk you through it

as quickly as possible now and make it

as simple as possible so from a high

level we have in the setup for our

system we have our different functions

so again this bit here is knowledge tool

so wec retrieval means that it's adding

the knowledge base retrieval tool which

is going to handle the knowledge base up

here but the one below it is a function

so we have our solar panel calculations

and then we have the properties and the

inputs it provides so we need the

address and we need the monthly bill and

both of them are required and the same

down here we have another function

called create lead which is going to log

the lead in the database it has a little

description and then it's going to need

the name the phone the address and all

of them are required now you don't need

to write these all yourself that you can

ask chbt to assist you with this and by

pasting in this entire function it's

going to show them exactly how you need

to do it so this is your reference and

chat gbd can help you to modify it now

when it comes to actually what functions

are being used the name of the function

here needs to match the name of the

function that you want to call in this

case I want to call this which is my

sort of full calculations function again

if I go down to here the name of the

function is called create uncore lead

and at the top I have create uncore lead

now this all comes together when you go

to the main.py file so over here if I

scroll down to the chat endpoint and I

scroll down to this section you'll see

in this part here if the assistant picks

up action required meaning one of the

tools has been triggered based off the

natural language description of capture

the lead details calculate the solar

potential if one of those are triggered

it's going to come down here and look up

for the different function names so we

have the solar panel calculations and

the create lead when the assistant

initiates the action it's going to pass

the name through and we can go okay

what's the tool call that it's called

what's the name of that okay it matches

the solar panel one great then we want

to call from our fun functions file the

solar panel calculations and that takes

the address argument and it takes a

monthly bill argument you can see this

back

here it takes an address and a monthly

bill and in this case we are just

pulling from the tool call we are

pulling the address as the first

parameter and the monthly bill as the

second parameter so might seem a bit

complicated but again if you paste this

into chat gbt it should understand what

you're trying to do same thing happens

down here with the create lead again we

needed to have three parameters in here

which is the name phone and address and

if the function name that was matched

within the tool matches the create lead

name here then it's going to trigger

that and pass the arguments in and then

output it so that might be a little bit

complex for some of you but I did

promise that you would understand how to

put these things together and how it all

fits you might need to go back and break

that down a couple of times but that is

how it works the next step for you to

set this up is to head over to Google

Cloud so cloud.google.com and you need

to come on here and create account I

assume you've already got a Gmail

account then you can click on go to

console you might need to do a bit of

setup and sort of creating an account on

the Google Cloud platform once you're in

you should see this and then what we

need to do is come up to the top left

let's create a new project I'll call

this Sol chatbot for this I'll be using

my YouTube projects billing account in

your case you'll need to set one up um

just so you're clear on the of cost I've

been using this a decent amount and I've

been charged under a dollar so these

things are very cheap to use for the API

usage so create your building account

you need to put a card on it so that

they're able to verify it and allow to

start using it but once you've set up

your billing account and put a card on

file you'll be able to select it here

and then for the organization I'll just

leave it as none so it's going to take a

second for it to create my project then

I can click select project here so that

I jump into it then once it's all set up

what you can do is click on the apis and

services section here and go to library

and then what you want to do is search

up geoc

coding geoc coding click on the geoc

coding

API need to enable that

when you successfully enable that it

should pop up with this API key message

so you can copy your API key here which

is what we're going to need to use and

our application to be able to call the

solar API so we can copy this save it

somewhere and go continue to Google Maps

um maybe later for the protecting my API

key then we'll go back to apis and

services let's close this on the side

then you'll see the solar API appear

here so we can click enable on the solar

API give that a

second

and we can scroll down to make sure we

have the GE coding API enabled great we

have our Google Cloud set up we have our

API key and we have the solar API and

the geocoding API enabled you want to

grab that API key and come back over to

our ret and if I scroll to the secret

section and click on Secrets should see

the Google Cloud API key section here

what you want to do is click the edit

button here and then paste in your API

key here and click update secret next we

need to set up our air table to log all

of the leads which will act as our

temporary CRM you can use obviously any

kind of CRM that you like I just like

using air table because I'm very

familiar with the API so in this example

we'll be using air table I do have a

base here that you'll be able to copy if

you want to get access to this CRM you

can copy and clone it over to your

account it'll be in the resource H as

well so there'll be a link to click on

that then you should see a page like

this and you will see this button here

that says copy base so if you copy that

it's your air table account you'll have

the sour it up as I've got it done here

then we need to do one more thing which

is to go onto our developer Hub on the

right here

and you will see all of our personal

access tokens so you'll need to click on

create token up here on the right give

it a name uh we'll call it lead gen

chatbot not the best name and we can go

to uh Scopes and we need to add data

records read data records write and then

we need to set up the access so in this

case I'm going to go down to Smith Sol

CRM and add that and then I can create

the token it'll then pop up with your

API key which you need to copy and then

bring back over to replit again and do

the same process so click here edit and

then paste it in and save the updated

API key the final step for setting up

these Keys is to get your open AI API

key to create or copy your API key for

openai you can come to platform.

open.com ai- keys and on the page here

you will see a button to create a new

secret key you can click this button it

will give you a new key you can copy

that back over to here and do the same

process of updating the API key now I've

all mentioned I had a bunch of people

asking in the comments that they

couldn't get access to the model that we

are using in this particular build

that's because you likely need to put

your card on file what you need to do is

go to the settings on the side here you

need to add a card for building you're

not necessarily going to be build for it

because you do have that free allowance

but you need to put a card on file so

that they allow you to use these models

just a little issue I saw in the

comments of the last video the very last

bit of setup we need to do here is to

get our air table based URL so what you

can do is click on the uh profile icon

in the corner click on developer Hub and

then we can click on web API

documentation and then you can scroll

down and click on your Smith solar CRM

and that will take you to the

documentation for your particular base

which is super handy if you scroll down

to the leads table in this case we want

to go

to create leads record and it will give

you a URL here so we want to copy this

all the way up to the end of the leads

word and we've already set this up when

I wrote the code this is already kind of

integrated into the function all you

need to do is head back and come to this

create lead function and replace that

entire bit there I already have mine in

there so it didn't change anything but

you should replace this URL with your

url with all of that done we are pretty

much ready to boot this thing up let's

just save this file make sure we've all

saved up let's go back and give the

main. power file a save as well and we

can click this big juicy Green Run

button on the top give it a second and

it's going to boot up on the left panel

here you'll see that there is no

assistants. Json and you'll see a file

pop up here in a second so give it a sec

and then we have the assistant. Json

file pop up the way that I've set this

up is that the create assistance

function will run at the start of every

time you run the application but what

it's going to do is check in the left

hand panel for this assistants. Json

file if there is none there it will try

to create a new assistant every

assistant that you create on the open AI

servers costs you an API usage so you

don't want to have creating a new

assistant every time you run the app so

what this does is if there is no

assistant file available it's going to

go through the creation process and look

at okay what model am I using okay what

am I tools am I using okay I have this

knowledge based I have these two

functions Etc and it will sort of

combine all those ingredients and then

push that up into the servers create the

assistant and then what it sends back is

the assistant ID and that assistant ID

is saved to this Json file and at the

end of this function it is sent back to

the main function if there's already

assistant created it's just going to

load it from the file which is great

we're not using unnecessary amounts of

API usage but if there isn't it's going

to create a new one and save that for

the next time what this means for you is

that if you want to recreate your

assistant and you want to change the

configuration say you want to change the

knowledge bace or you want to change how

the functions operate what you need to

do is delete this assistant. Json file

and then run the app again and it's

going to create it with the new settings

so just so you understand how I'm

managing the assistant ID and creation

of assistant in this application if you

did everything right you should have

this down in the bottom left corner

where it says it's running now and this

window would have popped up in the web

view but it says not found it's not an

error don't worry this is how it's

supposed to be but what you want to do

is click on this new tab button click

there and it's going to pop up with this

URL here so this is where our web

servers being hosted this is how we can

interact with the application we've just

built but we're not going to do it

through a browser we're going to do it

programmatically within voice flow which

brings us to our next step in this build

which is to sign up to voice flow if you

haven't already there's going to be a

link in the description if you want to

sign up there this is my favorite bot

building platform and this is what I

build a lot of the stuff I build at my

development company if we going to go

sort of the lower code route this is the

best platform that we have found for

creating these kind of builds I really

love using this platform and highly

recommend it if you're going to be doing

anything like this once you've logged in

you should see a screen like this now

what you're going to need to do is go to

my resource Hub and download the

voiceflow template so I've already

created a template for you um that does

everything you need to do out of the box

as you're going to see in a second but

in order to get that you need to sign up

to my resource Hub it's free and you can

download that file then once you've

downloaded the file you need to come

back to voice flow and click on this

import. VF file and then your downloads

you should be able to select your voice

playay file in this case there's one

down here when you click that and click

open it's going to pop up in the corner

and ask if you want to open the

assistant which you reply yes to and

then you will see a screen that looks a

little bit like this so this is as

simple as it is for us to be able to

deploy all of our functionality that

we've created and all of the assistant

API magic to a website and to a website

widget chat FL so just to walk you

through the voice flow build quickly we

have firstly here our create thread so

this is going to be where we paste in

our URL if you come back to this page

here come and copy this and then to

replace this you just need to go up to

the start you should have slash start at

the end of your url make sure it's

exactly like that it's your url SL start

that's all you need and then you can

come to this one as well generate

response and do the same thing replace

this URL with your

one and then we have everything set up

walk you through things again this is

where we create a thread by calling this

URL we're going back to our repet here

which has this function in our main.py

which is the/ start start so this is

going to create a new conversation this

is going to create a new thread in our

assistant and then we're going to be

able to say hey I'm Lucy Smith solo

assistant I can help you with any

questions about solar for your home I

can also calculate your potential solar

savings how can I help you today then

we're going to wait for the user's input

we're going to capture that then we're

going to send that off to our other

endpoint which is the SL chat and then

we have it here which pulls out the

message from the user passes it to our

assistant and it does all the magic and

here you can try to dig through it it's

it's quite complex and for those of you

who ask me why I use repet for these

kind of builds is because look at all of

this I would much rather have this on a

repet where I have full control over and

I really understand the environment

rather than trying to cram all of this

into voice flow and do that multiple

times in different stages in the app so

I keep it all here because we can sort

of tile ends make it look or pretty and

then just access it through one simple

um API endpoint and call this within

voice flow so that's the chat

functionality what we do is send off the

thread ID that we created earlier so

when we do this we're going to save the

thread ID that we get back from the API

and then we send it off with the last

utterance which is what the user said uh

so we send off the the user's message we

send off the thread ID to our endpoint

and it processes it and sends the AI

response back which we save as the last

response and then we come down here this

is a little snippet that someone from my

comment section gave to me instead of

using a AI task to remove this we can

actually just remove it using regular

Expressions which is great he actually

got it working so this is saving us on

AI tokens which is an important thing

that many of you brought up if you are

using something like voice flow a lot of

questions about yes they $50 but also

the token cost if you go over because we

have removed the AI task from this now

you not going to be using the AI task

down here which will save you a ton on

token costs last but not least we take

that trimmed response that's removed any

of the citations because when you talk

to the knowledge base sometimes it will

send citations they look kind of ugly so

we want to get rid of them then it's

going to send that last response as the

answer then it's going to loop back and

wait for the next user response and it

goes through this Loop kind of up here

down here and back over and over and

over again until the end of the

conversation in order for us to test

this we need to make sure that firstly

we have changed our URLs over as I

mentioned before so it should do USB or

youve repet URL taken from here and with

SL start on this one and then on this

one it should be/ chat everything else

should remain the same go back to your

replate make sure it is running and

everything is all good here this thing

should say stop and there should be a

little cursor here then we can click on

the Run button on the right here and

click run

test how can I help you today um what

are the best solar panels

so I'm going to ask to the knowledge

base and then we have it we're getting

responses from the knowledge base while

we're at it we can test the solar

calculator features so let's go I want

to calculate my savings so let's ask it

and get it to sendback this is why

they're so cool and so powerful these

particular Systems Prior to this

technology coming out and this new

release getting these kind of

interactions that are really natural and

flexible between user and the AI was was

quite difficult to say the least and

look at this I can ask it about one of

the tools to it has then it can come

back to me and say sure these are the

things I need and then if I just give it

partial information it's going to be

smart enough to ask me again for the

rest of the information and then pull

all of the information it needs out of

multiple messages and send it away to

our tools our functions our custom

actions with an KN back in and then give

us the answer so it's really amazing

stuff here we can

go could you please provide your address

and your average monthly electricity

bill so let's go uh get a new place here

in Florida

somewhere let's get this going

maybe this one won't work but let's

going really go bang and then it say I

pay $350 per month now if you are

watching this and you want to debug and

understand what's happening I have set

up print statements here so that you can

see what's going on with the application

uh while it's still doing the buffering

now if we scroll down a bit here you can

see that's the prior response here you

can see it received message so that's us

sending the message to the chatbot

calculating solar potential oh where's

it going calculating Sol potential for

that address with bill amount 350 so

it's taken it's passed through the

message and it's pulled out the address

and the bill amount so it's separate

variables then it's converted that to

coordinates you can see and then it's

retrieved the solid data for that

location successfully then we've

simplified the data that we get back

from the API and then we have the

assistant response here which is really

handy so that's printed out the exact

response that get sent in here so if you

come back you can see that we have the

proper response here so seems like this

guy has a $20,000 Federal incentive

available to cost without solar will be

$100,000 over 20 years the the API gives

us back information about the cash

purchase option Finance purchase option

and leasing option and then gives a bit

of a summary at the end um thanks to our

our prompted assistant knowing what to

do with the information and if you look

carefully at the end here you can see

that it is asking me for my information

my name and phone number so that one of

the team members can get in touch with

you this is the lead capture step so all

I need to do is go uh let's call myself

uh Hugh Jackman

phone number uh

301

9932 so it's going to take that name oh

huge Jackman not huge Jackman oops

forgive it a second yep thank you huge

one of our team members will reach out

to you shortly at the number you

provided now we should see in our air

table huge Jackin boom huge Jackin phone

number and it's also pulled their

address so that we have this information

I did also want to add another column

that was information so it could pull

some of the savings data from the uh the

output that we got from the solar

calculator and use this to sort of fill

out the lead information it could also

take some of the information from the

conversation say they asked a question

about hey what's the best panels what's

the best financing option we could get

the AI to analyze the conversation the

thread and pluck out the kind of

questions or concerns that they might

have so that we have some a little bit

more data if our guys are going to go

out and reach out to these people so

okay we have the have the address we

have the questions that we're asking we

have the phone number we have the name a

ton of good lead data and we also have a

little status column here so say if I

reach out to them we can go interested

not interested Etc and then we have a

working demo of our assistant within

voice flow the last step now is to

export this functionality to a website

via a little embeddable script that we

can add to any website which I'll show

you in a second but if you are enjoying

the video so far I'd really appreciate

if you give me a like on this I put a

ton of work into this to bring the

latest and most exciting things that I

can find that I'm working on right now

and giving them away to you for free in

the form of a tutorial and template as

well so if you are enjoying want to

support the Channel please leave like

right now would mean a lot to myself and

the community all righty now the last

step we need to do is click on this

Integrations tab on the left click here

and you should see these three boxes pop

up on the right here is an example of

how it's going to look on a website so

at the moment I'm happy with the styling

I believe the styling should carry over

when I export this template we have the

installation script which we're going to

grab in a second we have the general so

I've got the name description I've got

the chat persistance set to forget after

tab is closed and reloaded just so that

I can run through it a bunch of times

you probably want to set it to never

forget on the setting here but for the

purposes of testing I'm going to leave

it there then we have the appearance

section so I've modified this a bit with

the color logo Etc I'm pretty happy with

that so we can click copy here and in

this case I've got a demo website as I

did in my recent video I've just pulled

a free template off the internet

somewhere that looks kind of similar to

a Solar Company and all you need to do

to add it into any website is to come

down to the bottom and add it as a

script tag so here I'll delete the old

one at the bottom of most websites you

should see a stack of these script tags

all you need to do is sort of jump in

between a couple of them just to be safe

and then paste in that script tag there

and we can save that I can run the

website if I refresh it there you can

see I have the web page and at the

bottom right I have our chat bot and

then we have it hi I'm Lucy Smith solar

resistant I can help you with that we

can test it again what are my financing

options and then we have it we've got

cash purchases loans and financing solar

leases and power purchase agreements

great we can go um my address is and

then we can pull in this guys up here

5333 Schult street is and I pay $400 per

month as expected it's giving us back

the information we requested Federal

incentive cost without solar um some of

the leasing cash purchase and finance

options Etc it's asking for my name and

phone number so I can go um Bruce

Willis and my phone error is

301

pop back over to air Table and there we

go Bruce Willis with his address and his

phone number has all been logged

correctly into our air table CRM and

there's one final thing that I want to

mention about this kind of build which

is by running it on repet like this and

just running it within the editor you're

only running a very basic and and

limited server and and infrastructure to

manage this application so what you can

do within repet they actually have a

deployment option so that you can go

down on the bottom left here and click

on deployments and it's going to be

deployment options on the side side now

you can pick whichever one you like to

do you can follow through the setup so

set up your deployment you can pick how

much money you want to spend let's say

we just go one machine uh we can go

through essentially you can go through

the steps here and fill this out and

click on this deploy button then it's

going to actually deploy your

application to the servers that can run

constantly that are going to allow you

to call this whenever so when you're

taking a two production grade there is

another step required but in this video

I want you guys to just be able to spin

it up as quickly as possible if you want

me to go in depth on deployments and how

you can manage a production great

application rather than just a demo or a

prototype like this then let me know in

the comments below and I can definitely

get that out to you that's it for the

build I hope you've been able to follow

along I hope you see how insanely

powerful these things are as a lead

generation tool in this case also

helping customers learn more about the

business learn more about the products

they selling and being able to flexibly

use these different functions and pull

in information from the chat is just so

much better than the kind of stuff we've

had to work with before prior to this

assistance release getting some of this

functionality was close to Impossible
